Hi KSKB

I'd like to request a VM to join Poema IX KSKB-HOME, thanks.

OS Image: Debian 11
ASN: 200690
AS-SET: AS200690:AS-YOURSUNNY

My qualifications:
I have a PhD in computer networking from University of Arizona; dissertation link: https://hdl.handle.net/10150/625652
As part of my colloquium, I learned Internet routing including OSPF and BGP.
I understand how Ethernet switch works (see "self-learning" section of my dissertation).
I understand the difference between L2 and L3 protocols, and have designed an Ethernet-based protocol (see "NDNLP" section of my dissertation).
While I do not have DN42 experience, I have configured four BGP routers with internal transit, and I have joined two physical IXPs, which can be seen on my ASN.

Yours, Junxiao
