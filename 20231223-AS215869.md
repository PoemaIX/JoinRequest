Dear Poema IX Team,

My name is Naval and I am writing to express my interest in connecting to Poema IX via an OpenVPN tunnel. I am an individual enthusiast with the recently assigned AS215869 looking to engage and learn more in the field of network peering and BGP practices.
Here are some details about my setup:

ASN: AS215869
IPv6 Prefix: 2a11:f2c0:ffca::/48

      BGP daemon with BIRD 2
I have already established peering with a transit provider via BGP tunnel and I have an AS4242422711 (MAYA)  in DN42 network.
I am keen on utilizing this opportunity to expand my understanding and practical skills in networking, especially in a community-driven environment like Poema IX.
Could you please provide me with the necessary information and guidelines to proceed with setting up a tunnel connection? I am particularly interested in understanding the technical requirements and any specific configurations needed.
I am committed to adhering to Poema IX's policies and regulations and look forward to being an active and contributing member of your community.
Thank you for considering my request. I am eager to hear back from you with further instructions or any additional information required.
Best,

Naval.
