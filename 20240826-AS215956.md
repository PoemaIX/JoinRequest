Dear KSKB,

I found your IX via peeringdb and would like to make use of your offer for a free IXVM to connect to Poema-IX.
I Have a personal ASN (AS215956) to learn BGP and other routing and testing things out, at the moment I have 8 different POP locations (6 in Europe and 2 in North Amercia). This network is connected via VXLAN and running iBGP and OSPF. I would like to connect the IXVM to minimal 2 of my other locations in Europe (Frankfurt [DE], Paris [FR], Amsterdam [NL], London [UK]) depending on latency and route. For now I don't have any other PoP's in Asia-Pacific, but i'm looking into a PoP in Hong Kong and could also connect to that locations once its up and running.

I Currently have 1 downstream (also personal network) that I also provide with a free /47 range.

If you have any other question, please feel free to ask me.


With kind regards,
Met vriendelijke groeten,

AS215956
