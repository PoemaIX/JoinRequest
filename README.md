Hi KSKB

I'd like to request a VM to join Poema IX KSKB-HOME, thanks.

OS Image: Debian 11
ASN: 200690
AS-SET: AS200690:AS-YOURSUNNY
Email: ripe@yoursunny.dev

My qualifications:
I have a PhD in computer networking from University of Arizona; dissertation link: https://hdl.handle.net/10150/625652
As part of my colloquium, I learned Internet routing including OSPF and BGP.
I understand how Ethernet switch works (see "self-learning" section of my dissertation).
I understand the difference between L2 and L3 protocols, and have designed an Ethernet-based protocol (see "NDNLP" section of my dissertation).
While I do not have DN42 experience, I have configured four BGP routers with internal transit, and I have joined two physical IXPs, which can be seen on my ASN.

Yours, Junxiao

Dear Poema IX Team,

My name is Naval and I am writing to express my interest in connecting to Poema IX via an OpenVPN tunnel. I am an individual enthusiast with the recently assigned AS215869 looking to engage and learn more in the field of network peering and BGP practices.
Here are some details about my setup:

ASN: AS215869
IPv6 Prefix: 2a11:f2c0:ffca::/48

      BGP daemon with BIRD 2
I have already established peering with a transit provider via BGP tunnel and I have an AS4242422711 (MAYA)  in DN42 network.
I am keen on utilizing this opportunity to expand my understanding and practical skills in networking, especially in a community-driven environment like Poema IX.
Could you please provide me with the necessary information and guidelines to proceed with setting up a tunnel connection? I am particularly interested in understanding the technical requirements and any specific configurations needed.
I am committed to adhering to Poema IX's policies and regulations and look forward to being an active and contributing member of your community.
Thank you for considering my request. I am eager to hear back from you with further instructions or any additional information required.
Best,

Naval.

Hello,

I have known Poema IX since I got started. As a university student, I am really interested in it for educational purposes but I was worried about messing it up.

After the study I'd like to join Poema IX now. My name is Xing Qingyu and registered ASN215502 announced 2a13:aac4:f000::/44 subnet, my endpoint located in Kaohsiung with ISP HINET (dynamic ipv4 NAT only). I think that ZeroTier or OpenVPN tunnel could be ok.

Thank you for considering my request.

Dear KSKB,

I found your IX via peeringdb and would like to make use of your offer for a free IXVM to connect to Poema-IX.
I Have a personal ASN (AS215956) to learn BGP and other routing and testing things out, at the moment I have 8 different POP locations (6 in Europe and 2 in North Amercia). This network is connected via VXLAN and running iBGP and OSPF. I would like to connect the IXVM to minimal 2 of my other locations in Europe (Frankfurt [DE], Paris [FR], Amsterdam [NL], London [UK]) depending on latency and route. For now I don't have any other PoP's in Asia-Pacific, but i'm looking into a PoP in Hong Kong and could also connect to that locations once its up and running.

I Currently have 1 downstream (also personal network) that I also provide with a free /47 range.

If you have any other question, please feel free to ask me.


With kind regards,
Met vriendelijke groeten,

AS215956
